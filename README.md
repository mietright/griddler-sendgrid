Griddler::Sendgrid
==================

This is an adapter that allows [Griddler](https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler) to be used with
[SendGrid's Parse API].

[SendGrid's Parse API]: https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'griddler-sendgrid'
```

Usage
-----

* SendGrid has done a [great
  tutorial](https://sendgrid.com/blog/receiving-email-in-your-rails-app-with-griddler/)
  on integrating Griddler with your application.
* And of course, view our own blog post on the subject over at [Giant
  Robots](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/handle-incoming-email-with-griddler).
* *Note:* Make sure to uncheck the "Spam Check" and "Send Raw" checkboxes on the [Parse Webhook settings page](http://sendgrid.com/developer/reply), otherwise the returned parsed email will have the body stripped out.
